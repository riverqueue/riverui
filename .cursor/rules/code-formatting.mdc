# Code Formatting Guidelines

## Run Formatter Before Completing Tasks
- Always run `npm run fmt` before considering any JavaScript/TypeScript task complete
- Always run `make lint` before considernig any Go task complete.
- This ensures code quality, consistency, and prevents lint errors from being committed

## Formatting Process
1. Make your code changes
2. Run `npm run fmt` (for JS/TS/CSS) or `make lint` (for Go) to apply formatting and fix lint issues
3. Review any changes made by the formatter
4. Commit your changes only after the formatter runs successfully

## Benefits
- Consistent code style across the project
- Catches potential issues early
- Prevents lint errors from being committed
- Reduces code review time spent on formatting issues
- Ensures all code meets project standards

## Common Issues Prevented
- Inconsistent indentation
- Missing semicolons
- Unused imports
- Improper type usage (like `any`)
- React hooks usage errors
- Unused variables

## Integration with Development Workflow
- Consider adding a pre-commit hook to automatically run the formatter
- Use IDE extensions that format on save
- Configure your editor to use the project's ESLint and Prettier settings
