# Storybook Component Stories

## Story File Location
- Story files should be colocated with their components in the same directory
- Example: [src/components/EditableBadge.stories.tsx](mdc:src/components/EditableBadge.stories.tsx) is located next to [src/components/EditableBadge.tsx](mdc:src/components/EditableBadge.tsx)
- Use the `.stories.tsx` extension for story files

## Component Story Organization
Components should have their stories organized as follows:
```
src/components/
  ├── MyComponent/
  │   ├── MyComponent.tsx
  │   ├── MyComponent.stories.tsx
  │   └── MyComponent.test.tsx
  └── OtherComponent.tsx
      ├── OtherComponent.stories.tsx
      └── OtherComponent.test.tsx
```

## Story Examples
Some examples of well-structured stories:
- [src/components/Badge.stories.tsx](mdc:src/components/Badge.stories.tsx)
- [src/components/JobTimeline.stories.tsx](mdc:src/components/JobTimeline.stories.tsx)
- [src/components/QueueDetail.stories.tsx](mdc:src/components/QueueDetail.stories.tsx)

## Story Configuration
- Global configuration and decorators are defined in [.storybook/preview.tsx](mdc:.storybook/preview.tsx)
- Stories should demonstrate different states and variations of the component
- Include interactive examples where appropriate using Storybook controls
